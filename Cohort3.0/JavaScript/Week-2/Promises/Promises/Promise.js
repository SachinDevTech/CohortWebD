// A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations more effectively than traditional callback functions, providing a cleaner and more manageable way to deal with code that executes asynchronously, such as API calls, file I/O, or timers.


// Using a function that returns a promise
// Ignore the function definition of setTimeoutPromisifed for now
function setTimeoutPromisified(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
  }
  
  function callback() {
      console.log("3 seconds have passed");
  }
  
  setTimeoutPromisified(3000).then(callback)
